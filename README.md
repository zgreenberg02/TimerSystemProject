# TimerSystemProject

The Timer System is a system that I created as a voulnteer project for the local America Ninja Warrior Gym. The Timer System is to time the participants in completing obstacle courses pushing the green button to start the timer and the red buton to stop the timer. To reset the timer for the next participant, either of the buttons can be pushed and held down. Additinoally there is a small key fob that can be used to start, stop, and reset the Timer System. The use of the key fob is for someone to be able to controll the timer without using the buttons.

The Timer System set up leaning on the back of a couch (instead of hanging on a wall) with the start and stop buzzers by it.
