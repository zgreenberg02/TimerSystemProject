# Timer System Project
The Timer System is an electronic timing device that I developed as a volunteer project for the local America Ninja Warrior Gym. The system is designed to time participants as they complete obstacle courses. It features a green start button to begin the timer, a red stop button to halt the timer, and a reset function available by pressing and holding either button. Additionally, a key fob allows remote control of the timer to start, stop, and reset the system. <br /> 

## System Overview
The Timer System offers an efficient, easy-to-use solution for timing obstacle course participants. Designed for simplicity, it features intuitive controls that allow gym staff to quickly start, stop, and reset the timer between trials. <br /> <br />

### Challenges and Solutions
During the development of this Timer System, I encountered a few challenges: <br /> 
1. Button wiring complexity: The wiring for the buttons required careful planning to ensure reliable operation. I designed a clear and concise wiring diagram to help streamline the process. <br /> 
2. Remote control integration: Integrating the key fob added a layer of complexity, but I overcame this by researching compatible wireless communication protocols and implementing the necessary software.<br /> 

Despite these challenges, I successfully developed a system that meets the gym's needs, allowing for an easy-to-use and efficient timing solution. <br /> <br /> 

## Conclusion
The Timer System was a rewarding project that allowed me to apply my skills in CAD Design, manufacturing, electronics, wiring, and software development. It is a practical solution for the gym, providing a streamlined and reliable timing process for participants. I am proud to have contributed to the local community and look forward to future impactful opportunities.
