# TimerSystemProject

The Timer System is a system that I created as a voulnteer project for the local America Ninja Warrior Gym. The Timer System is used to time the participants in completing obstacle courses. By pushing the green button the timer will start and pushing the red button the timer will stop. To reset the timer for the next participant or trial, either of the buttons can be pushed and held down. Additinoally there is a small key fob that can be used to start, stop, and reset the Timer System. The use of the key fob is for someone to be able to controll the timer without using the buttons. <br /> <br />

The Timer System set up leaning on the back of a couch (instead of hanging on a wall) with the start and stop buzzers by it. <br /> <br />
